This project was developed on ruby because of the flexibility and accesability of web crawling and scraper gems. The scraper gem used is Mechanize. I used a database to store the newly created ruby objects by using postgresql.

##Object Oriented and Model View Controller

This project was developed with the goal of creating ruby book objects by scraping information out of the amazon web page. We based the architecture and structure of the code on the MVC concept. We have a controller page an entities page and a ORM page to communicate with the database.
